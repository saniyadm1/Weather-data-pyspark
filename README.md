# Weather-data-pyspark
- The main aim of this project is to do analysis on the weather dataset and
predict the average temperature, humidity and dew point of next year on the basis
of the previous years. The relation between temperature and dew
point was calculated to understank their interrelation to each other. 
Temperature was predicted using dew point by Linear Regression. Temperature
was also calculated during Smoke and other adverse conditions.
- This can be useful for pilots in order to predict the weather conditions before the
take off. Weather predictions can be useful for researchers or Scientists to study
about global warming. This can also be used to regulate the pollution based on
increase in temperature.
- The dataset used for the analysis is delhi weather data which has been taken from
the Kaggle website. The dataset consists of 20 columns and 100991 rows. Out of
20 columns we are interested only in the Date and time column, temperature,
humidity and Dew point.The forecasting is also performed on the same data set for the
next year.
- To be able to run this, you must have Jupyter notebook installed on your machine.
- It can be run on any platform: Windows, Linux, Mac-OS
- Installations needed:
Anaconda prompt, Jupyter notebook, numpy, pandas, sklearn, NLTK
- Hardware requirement: Any operating system that supports Python. Less than 2 GB RAM.
